        <h1><span class="year">Late 2008</span>Before Tanki Online</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Two months before the start of active development of Tanki Online by AlternativaPlatform team, they came up
            with a demo what was supposed to demonstrate the possibilities of the server platform. The code name for the
            demo was “Tanks”. It was a multiplayer action game about tanks based on Flash. The demo was developed using
            the Alternativa3D 5 graphics engine. Tanks became the prototype of Tanki Online. Garage there was much more
            diverse than the one in Tanks for Two. Players had a choice of three types of tanks: light, medium and
            heavy. However, there was only one gun. It required one, two and three hits to destroy light, medium and
            heavy hull respectively. Tanks had only one map that actually was a single 3D-model (maps in Tanki Online
            are made of many blocks called props). It also contained water.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h1><span class="year">2009</span>Tanki Online: The Beginning</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Closed beta testing of the new game called Tanki Online began on May 8, 2009. To participate in the testing,
            it was necessary to send a questionnaire to tanki@alternativaplatform.com
            It is noteworthy that at this point, the game got an award at the Game Developers Conference (GDC 2009) in
            the category “Best game without a publisher.” This clearly shows that the game received international
            recognition already in the test phase.
            Just one month after that, on June 4, open testing began.
            The game was on main server in the beginning of summer 2009.

            Community was just beginning to form itself. Everyone was new to each other. Developers played together with
            all the other players. Prices were completely different, the game was full of bugs, glitches and lags. In
            short, one may say it was total chaos … For example, Firebird had an awfully long visual after-effect on the
            enemy. This effect only vanished after server restart. Of course this bug was quickly corrected. Apart from
            hull and turret, it was also possible to change the tank’s engine. Various elements of tanks were gradually
            wearing out. Hulls – with each hit they got, turrets – from every shot they fired and the engine got worn
            out with the distance it covered. Life was difficult for newbies as everything was wearing out really
            quickly and there were not enough funds to constantly repair it. So developers had to give up these elements
            of gameplay. There were no second generation turrets and hulls, the barrel of Railgun had the length of Wasp
            and the damage it did was huge (M0 Railgun had a damage of around 100 HP) During that time, there was only
            one kind of battle supply – First Aid Kit. The picture on it showed a syringe instead of a red cross that we
            got used to so much. That’s why players that were using it were often called druggers while the supply
            itself was commonly known as “drug”.
            At the same time we started seeing first players who were practicing parkour.
            There was an idea of introducing a racing mode. Map-maker called Avocado makes a map called Monte Carlo that
            was supposed to become one of racing tracks. The idea was scrapped, while the map remained. It’s still quite
            popular with players.
            Capture the Flag mode was added to the game on July 31, 2009. Since then Tanki Online has changed a lot and
            now there are a few things that remind us of this period.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1><span class="year">Late 2009 – Mid 2010</span>Surge In Popularity</h1>
        <br>
        <p>By the time the game already had 200 000 players.
            That’s when double damage, double armor, nitro and mine supplies were introduced. From that moment activated
            supplies were shown on top of players’ tanks.
            Administration started to organize various contests.
            In 2009 developers decided to create a gun that could kill enemies and heal teammates at the same time. This
            is how Isida was born. Originally players could heal themselves using Isida (when shooting). This fact made
            Isida the most powerful gun hence unbalancing the game. Game designers had to remove this feature. Since
            then the turret became the Isida we all know today.
            Coming close to the Christmas and New Year, a special gift for all tankmen was released – an experimental
            version of Gold Box with 1000 crystals in it. After that the value of the box was changed to 100 crystals
            and it was left in the game.
            Physics of tanks weren’t perfect. There were various bugs in geometry of levels. Lots of changes were coming
            soon. The game had already had around 500,000 players. A notable event was the appearance of the first
            marshal. His nickname was T7000.
            At the end of 2009 AlternativaPlatform started working on a new project called <b>Tanki Online 2.0</b> while
            continuing to develop existing Tanki Online. This was meant to be an absolutely new product with more
            realistic graphics, more user-friendly interface and a whole lot more useful functions (social networks,
            mobile platform, and so on). However, after a year and a half of development there was a change of plans and
            it was decided to cancel the project and add all the new functions (new server platform, updated graphics,
            etc.) into the existing version of Tanki Online step by step.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1><span class="year">Late 2010</span>Era of the Second Generation</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The name of the period itself explains global changes in Tanki Online. Second generation of weapons and hulls
            was introduced. They were three hulls: Viking, Hornet and Mammoth and three turrets: Thunder, Ricochet and
            Freeze.
            Many new maps were added. The looks of the game changed significantly. Tanki Online had from 1 000 000 to 4
            000 000 active players at that time.
            The demand for first generation weapons dropped significantly. There were rumors about a mysterious gun
            called Shaft.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1><span class="year">2011-2012</span>The Making of Shaft</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This was the most awaited gun in the history of Tanki Online. The marketing department says that, when being
            first released, it was bought at a speed of 3 guns per second. The length of the gun was such that if you
            had it on a wasp, it would be two times the size of the hull. At first the shaft gun had a lot of
            disadvantages but the biggest of which was its inability to hold a full charge (it left the barrel as soon
            as you fully charged the gun). But there was one good point – the damage it dealt – M3 Shaft had a damage of
            250!
            Then it was temporarily removed from the game for rebalancing. Updated Shaft was able to hold its charge,
            but M3 damage was lowered from 250 to 200.
            On March 25, 2012 Tanki Online welcomed its 10 000 000th player! His nickname was lYonsl.
            The game was getting really popular.
            On April 1 players spotted a strange item in their Garages – the Green Triangle. Lots of speculations were
            made regarding its origin and purpose. Many thought that it was an element of some quest. Players were even
            calling battles “Green Triangle”.
            Developers introduced really expensive paints with good protection from various turrets.
            On February 14, 2011 a new gun was added to the main servers – the famous Smoky XT. It was more expensive
            than a standard Smoky and had better parameters. During one week, any player with a rank of Warrant Officer
            1 and higher could buy Smoky XT and use it till February 22. The next day Smoky XT’s damage was increased
            and it was decided to keep the gun in the game for two more days. The event got lots of feedback from
            players (not a surprise as there were no changes like that before). The new gun became a number one
            discussion topic both in the game and in the forum. At 4:00 (UTC+0) on February 24 Smoky XT was removed from
            the game forever.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1><span class="year">2012 Second Half</span>Update 1.100</h1>
        <br>
        <p>September 6 became a really special day for the project as it brought two of the biggest changes in the game,
            a new game mode called Control Points and the new graphics.
            3 days after the 1.100 update we saw the 15 000 000th player registering in Tanki Online, his name was
            adilov.amir.
            In the beginning of October the Tanki Online forum was transfered to a new, more user-friendly engine.
            On November 23 we saw the removal of Madness map from the servers because of its configuration.
            December 17 brought us one of the most serious updates – rebalance. The update changed the characteristics
            of the guns and their availability according to ranks.</p>
